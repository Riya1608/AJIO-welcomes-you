        <p>AJIO is the digital fashion extension of Reliance that unveiled in April 2016 at Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai. AJIO, a fashion and lifestyle brand, is Reliance Retail’s first pan-Indian ecommerce venture and is the ultimate fashion destination for styles that are handpicked, on trend and at prices that are the best you’ll find anywhere.</p>
        
        <p>Celebrating fearlessness and uniqueness, AJIO.com is constantly looking to bring a fresh, current and accessible perspective to personal style.</p>
        
        <p>At the heart of it all, AJIO’s philosophy and initiatives point to one simple truth – inclusivity and acceptance as the only way to make our society a little more humane. And along the way, just a little more stylish, whether it’s through creating capsule collections that make putting together great looks easy, making exclusive international brands available in one place, reviving India’s rich textile heritage through the Indie collection or making great style an easy purchase through the in-house brand AJIO Own.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>AJIO deals in categories of womenswear, menswear, kidswear and technology. With fashion technology in particular, AJIO forayed into a category that combined the convenience of technology with the aesthetics of contemporary fashion by featuring a carefully handpicked selection of premium gadgets and tech accessories.</p>
        <p>With the advanced internet infrastructure built by JIO and a robust physical retail business built by Reliance Retail, we’re creating a differentiated e-commerce model for India through AJIO. This model will entail seamless integration of online and offline models while innovating across superior customer experience, delivery services and payment ecosystem.</p>
        <p><i>The AJIO app is available for download on the Apple App Store & Google Play.</i></p>
        <p> Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance IndustriesNSE -1.07 % is extending the Jio brand name to new businesses, the latest being a fashion ecommerce site dubbed AJIO.com, said people aware of the development. </p>
        <p> The company has named its telecom unit Reliance Jio and its upcoming digital wallet Jio Money. AJIO.com has been tested among some employees since December, said the people cited above. It will be opened to all employees later this week through an official communication, they said.

            Reliance plans to adopt a dual ecommerce model similar to Flipkart’s, which operates a general merchandise marketplace and fashion portal Myntra, which it acquired in May last year for about $300 million. 
        </p>
        <p>
            
            This strategy stems from high margins in the fashion business, while the marketplace ventures are low margin but encompass a vast range of products. 
        </p>
        <p>
            
            The <em>AJIO</em> labels will be different from those sold by Reliance Trends and Reliance Brands. AJIO plans to leverage Reliance Jio’s digital platform as well as the 3,000-strong Reliance Retail network for deliveries and returns. Reliance didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on Saturday. ET had reported last July that Reliance had appointed Sanjay Mehra, a veteran of US firm Wolverine World Wide that owns Caterpillar shoes and Merrell apparel, as chief executive of its fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
             Reliance is expected to make a high-profile entry into the general merchandising marketplace where it will compete with Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal.
